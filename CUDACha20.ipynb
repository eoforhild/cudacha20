    "## Abstract\n",
    "The ChaCha20 cipher is very easy to think about in terms of parallelizing it. The keystream is generated in 64-byte blocks, and generating the keystream is done via a counter-mode-esque construction of the stream cipher. This means that the generation is not dependent on any past state (i.e. you can manually set the counter for a block, then consume that state to get a block of the keystream). This allows for easy parallelization where every thread can generate a chunk of blocks of the keystream and individually encrypt sections of the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the security of the stream, the cipher works a little like a pseudorandom function; hence, changing the counter of the state by just one bit result in an entirely different block output. This block output is also assumed to look indistinguishable from a randomly sampled byte string. When the block output is xor'd with the message, what you get is indistinguishable from a randomly sampled byte string.\n",
    "\n",
    "This cipher is typically used in network communication which is why it is a \"stream\" cipher because it does not require the message to be padded to exactly the size of the block. It allows for encryption of streams of data where the exact size of the message is not known."
